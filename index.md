# Welcome

The following blog is a collection of research (vaguely) related to infosec that will ultimately serve as a brain dump. As such, it will contain brief or incomplete entries as well as the occasional highlighted dead end. I'm hopeful someone can salvage something useful out of my work. If you see an error, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Spacecow99/Spacecow99.github.io/issues) and I will try to address it as soon as possible. Enjoy ðŸ™ƒ
